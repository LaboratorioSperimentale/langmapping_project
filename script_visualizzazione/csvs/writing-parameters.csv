In the 1960s, the number of speakers of the language fell to less than 100,due to disease and contact with the non-indigenous population colonizing their region. In 1968,the Kaxuiâna were moved to the Parque do Tumucumaque IT in Pará, an area where Trió [tri] wasthe dominant language, and they began to be assimilated into Trió. So since the 1970s until2010, the Kaxuiâna children grew up speaking, reading and writing predominantly Trió with thelanguage on the verge of extinction (Grupioni 2018). However, since 2010 the Kaxuianas have madea comeback, creating 8 new villages of their own on the river system where they were originallyfrom. About half of the Kaxuiana children now grow up speaking Kaxuiana, while the other halfspeak Trió or Hixkaryana [hix] as their mother tongue. Some young people, all adults.
